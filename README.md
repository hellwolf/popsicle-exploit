# Motivation

Following the tutorials from [Certora](https://www.certora.com/) about [Popsicle Finance
Exploit](https://github.com/Certora/Tutorials/blob/master/08.Lesson_WorkingWithInvariants/WritingRules/PopsicleFinance/),
it is an interesting exercise to try out if we could reproduce the same exploit using
[dapptool](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/) and [echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna).
